        <h4>Malvertising: The Hidden Threat of Online Ads</h4>
        <img src={VirusRecovery} alt="" />
        <p>
          In today's digital age, where online advertising is an integral part of marketing strategies, a growing
          concern has emerged: malvertising. This deceptive practice exploits the trust users place in advertisements,
          leading to potential security threats and data breaches.

        <span className={styles.title}>What is Malvertising?</span>
        <p className="mt-3">
          Malvertising, or malicious advertising, involves injecting harmful code into legitimate online advertisements.
          These ads can appear on well-known platforms, social media sites, or even reputable news websites. Once users
          click on these ads, they may unknowingly download malware, ransomware, or other malicious software onto their
          devices.

        <span className={styles.title}>How Does Malvertising Work?</span>
        <p className="mt-3">
          Malvertisers often use sophisticated techniques to evade detection. They may create seemingly harmless ads
          that lead users to compromised websites, where the malware is hosted. Alternatively, they can serve malicious
          ads directly through ad networks without the publisher’s knowledge, leveraging vulnerabilities in browsers or
          software to execute their payload.

        <p className="mt-3">
          The consequences of falling victim to malvertising can be severe. Users may experience data theft, financial
          loss, or identity theft. For businesses, a malvertising attack can lead to compromised customer data, damaging
          their reputation and leading to costly remediation efforts.

        <span className={styles.title}>Recent Malvertising Cases</span>
        <p className="mt-3">
          Malvertising is hitting some big names and high-traffic platforms. Here are a few notable cases:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Spotify (2022) :</b> A malvertising campaign targeted Spotify users, redirecting them to phishing sites
            that mimicked the music platform’s login page. Thousands of accounts were compromised before the attack was
            caught and stopped.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Reddit (2023) :</b> Hackers used malicious ads on Reddit to redirect users to fake surveys that promised
            prizes. Instead of winning gift cards, users ended up giving away personal information to cybercriminals.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Slack (2024) :</b> A malvertising campaign infiltrated Slack’s ad network, leading users to phishing
            pages that resembled Slack’s login screen. Multiple corporate accounts were compromised, exposing sensitive
            company data.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div className="mt-4 mb-4">
        <span className={styles.title}>What’s Next for Malvertising?</span>
        <p className="mt-3">
          Unfortunately, malvertising isn’t going away any time soon. As cybersecurity companies develop more advanced
          defences, hackers find new ways to sneak their malicious ads into ad networks.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3">
          However, AI-powered security systems are getting better at detecting and filtering out malicious ads before
          they reach your screen. Companies like Confiant and GeoEdge are leading the charge, using machine learning to
          detect suspicious behaviour in ad networks.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3">
          For now, it’s up to all of us to stay alert and keep our devices protected. By taking these precautions, you
          can significantly reduce your risk of falling victim to malvertising.

        <span className={styles.title}>How to Protect Yourself?</span>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Use Ad Blockers:</b> Consider using ad-blocking extensions that can filter out potentially harmful ads.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Keep Software Updated:</b> Regularly update your operating system, browser, and security software to
            patch vulnerabilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Be Wary of Too-Good-to-Be-True Ads:</b> If an ad is promising you a free iPhone or $10,000 for working
            from home, it’s probably a scam. These ads are often designed to lure in victims with enticing but fake
            offers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Install Antivirus Software:</b> Reliable antivirus tools like Bitdefender, Kaspersky, or Malwarebytes can
            detect and block malware that may sneak onto your device through malvertising. These programs often come
            with phishing protection as well.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Use a Secure DNS Service:</b> Services like Quad9 or OpenDNS can block access to malicious sites by
            filtering the DNS requests, stopping malvertising sites before they even load.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Be Cautious with Clicks:</b> Avoid clicking on ads that seem suspicious or offer unrealistic promises.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Educate Yourself and Others:</b> Stay informed about the latest security threats and educate friends and
            family to help them recognize and avoid malvertising.
          </li>
        </ul>
